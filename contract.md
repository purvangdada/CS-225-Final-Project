Communication

Team Meetings: Our team will meet at least once a week every Monday from 10:00 to 12:00 am. Each member will record what they have done and what they plan to do during the week for the project.

Assistance: The team can communicate through email and through imessage.

Respect: Each member will have a designated turn to speak during the weekly meetings. Decisions will be made with a majority vote, ties will be resolved with rock paper scissors if necessary.



Collaboration

Work Distribution: The team will decide together the distribution of deliverables each week. If the difficulty of a deliverable is notable beyond that of others, adjustments will be considered and made to keep the workload fair.

Time Commitment: Each group member is expected to work for approximately 4 hours each work as necessary. If a deliverable is particularly easy or difficult, this should be presented to the group so that the workload can be shared evenly. Time conflicts or difficulties should be discussed during the weekly team meeting.

Conflict Resolution: Disagreements should be presented during the weekly team meeting in a constructive manner. If possible, the group will try to find a solution for however long is reasonable before communicating with the TA.
